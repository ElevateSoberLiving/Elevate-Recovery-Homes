        q: "WHAT IS A RECOVERY HOME?",
        a: "A recovery home is a group residence where recovering addicts and alcoholics reside as they transition back into society. These are drug-free and alcohol-free environments that usually have a resident manager or counselor who enforces the rules and oversees all the activities at the home. The residents pay fees and have daily chores to maintain the household. Every household member must follow all of the rules to continue living at the house, including random drug and alcohol testing. /n <br/> Many individuals in recovery stay at the recovery home for a few months, but you can stay as long as you want as long as you comply with all house rules. At Elevate Recovery Homes, you can come and go as you please as long as you don't use drugs or alcohol. We have a set nightly curfew. Transitioning back to everyday life is more accessible here because you live with others in recovery who are also living a sober lifestyle. All of our members have a common goal: maintaining their sober lifestyle and supporting and encouraging each other along the way."

        q: "WHY LIVE IN A RECOVERY ENVIRONMENT?",
        a: "After completing a treatment program for substance use disorder, where you have been in a controlled environment, it is common to feel unsettled about what to expect when you return home. You may not trust yourself to resist the temptations of drugs and alcohol. A recovery environment provides a safe and productive place to transition from a residential treatment center to a traditional living environment. It is an opportunity to live among like-minded people in recovery, who share their experience, strength, and hope with one another. By deciding to receive after-treatment care in a recovery home, you are taking measures to prevent a relapse from happening."
