        q: "WHAT IS A RECOVERY HOME?",
        a: "A recovery home is a group residence where recovering addicts and alcoholics live as they transition back into society after treatment or relapse. These are drug-free and alcohol-free residences that usually have a house manager or counselor who makes sure all members abide by the rules and oversees any activities at the home. Residents pay fees and will have daily chores to maintain the household. Every household member must follow all of the rules to continue living at the house, including random drug and alcohol testing. Many individuals in recovery stay at the recovery home for a few months, but you can stay as long as you want as long as you comply with all house rules. At Elevate Recovery Homes, you can come and go as you please as long as you don't use drugs or alcohol. We have a set nightly curfew. Transitioning back to everyday life is more accessible here because you live with others in recovery who are also living a sober lifestyle. All of our members have a common goal: maintaining their sober lifestyle and supporting and encouraging each other along the way."

        q: "WHY LIVE IN A RECOVERY ENVIRONMENT?",
        a: "After completing a treatment program for substance use disorder where you have been in a controlled environment, it is common to feel uneasy about what to expect when you return home. You may not yet trust yourself to resist the old triggers of drug use and alcohol use. A recovery environment provides a safe and productive place to transition from a residential treatment center to a traditional living environment. It is an opportunity to live among like-minded people in recovery, who share their experience, strength, and hope with one another. By deciding to receive after-treatment care in a recovery home, you are taking measures to prevent a relapse from happening."
