            <h2>Our Facilities</h2>
            <p>
                Elevate Recovery provides a location to maximize our memberâ€™s ability to engage in a future-focused lifestyle while providing them with the comfort and safety necessary to treat the disease of addiction. In most intensive outpatient drug and alcohol rehab programs, clients visit a facility, receive treatment, and then leave. At Elevate Recovery, our members will have the option to stay at a carefully designed recovery residence and be guided through a process that keeps them engaged and immersed in a lifestyle of recovery, growth, and success throughout each stage of their program.

            <h3>HOW WE CAN HELP</h3>
            <h4>STRUCTURE</h4>
            <p>
                We provide the daily Structure, personal Accountability, community Support, and a plan of Action needed to lead a healthy recovery program. If you are looking for a structured sober living environment and comprehensive after-treatment solutions, Elevate Recovery is the answer
                </p>
            <h4>ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>
            <p>
                Having people in our lives who hold us accountable for our behavior proves to be extremely helpful. This can help us to stay on track and keep our focus on the things that matter. Honesty and accountability play a vital role in recovery.
                </p>
            <h4>SUPPORT</h4>
            <p>
                Elevate provides a support system that you can rely on to stay clean and sober. People who spend time living with other sober people after treatment are more likely to maintain their sobriety and build a strong program of recovery.
                </p>
            <h4>ACTION</h4>
            <p>
                The three other pillars just discussed culminate through consistent action. The most essential instrument in recovery is participating in it. We know from experience that a mind, body, and spirit aligned with intent and perseverance, gives us the best chance for lifelong success.
