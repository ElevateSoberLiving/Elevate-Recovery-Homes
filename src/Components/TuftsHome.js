            <p>
                Our Men's Recovery Home is located in Englewood, Colorado. The beautiful, 2,300 square foot house features four bedrooms, two full baths, multiple living room areas, a home gym, a dedicated work desk with computer and printer, a hot tub, and a spacious backyard. It is truly a warm and family-friendly home. The Tufts Home is staffed with a dedicated 24/7 House Manager and Peer Recovery Coach. We have a zero-tolerance drug and alcohol policy and require our members to participate in House meetings and suggest a minimum of five (5) recovery based activities per week and follow all other rules of the House.
