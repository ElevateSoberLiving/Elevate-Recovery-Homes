                        <h5>INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT THROUGH MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS AND ACTION</h5><br/>  
                        At Elevate Recovery Homes, our mission is to support members in creating a life of purpose and value. Early sobriety is much more than abstaining from drugs and alcohol. It is an opportunity to explore and engage in a completely new way of living. Our approach is simple, yet progressive. Equip members with the tools and principles to maintain sobriety and enable an overall lifestyle of growth and success, we do this by addressing the whole person, not just the substance use. <br/>
                        We want our members to see how much greater and fuller their lives can be. An increased focus on physical, emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual health allows our members to envision a full life that is self-directed, satisfying, and joyous. Every member that comes through our doors will complete an Elevation Plan which is designed for our members to work on themselves, focus on their process and goals, and have fun doing it! By rising to the challenges presented, they start to see and realize their full potential. By experiencing compassionate care, increased responsibility, and hope, they develop the foundation necessary for independent healthy living. We know it’s possible, and we invite you to join us!<br/>
                        At Elevate, we allow for more personal attention, individualized programming, and increased accountability. We want our home to feel like your home – not a program, institution, or facility. With a handful of roommates, you have space and support to learn and grow. We want you and your roommates to support, celebrate and hold each other accountable so that you develop meaningful relationships that can last a lifetime. We schedule group activities, field trips, community meals, house meetings, and sober anniversary parties to help nurture these relationships and celebrate life’s moments together.

                    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>At Elevate Recovery, our philosophy is built on four important principles for successful long - term recovery: Structure, Accountability, Support, and Action.
                        These pillars help guide our members through the growth stages of the program
                    </p>
                    <h4>STRUCTURE</h4>
                    <p>
                        Beginning a program of recovery after receiving treatment for substance use disorder isn’t always easy.There will be times when you may feel like giving up, when thoughts of drinking or using are especially strong, or when you might feel like a failure.Therefore, it is important to have a structured system and routine in place to keep you on the right track.Taking healthy and intentional steps to develop a sober lifestyle will ensure that you have the support you need.
                    </p>
                    <h4>ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>
                    <p>
                        Accountability is one of the main things we need to live a life of health and total freedom.Having people in our lives who hold us accountable for our thoughts and actions prove to be extremely helpful and keeps our focus on the things that matter.For an individual in recovery, what is truly important is an addiction - free life.Honesty and accountability play a vital role in this process.
                    </p>
                    <h4>SUPPORT</h4>
                    <p>
                        A support system is a network of people who provide an individual with practical, emotional, and spiritual support that they can rely on to stay clean and sober.Your support system or community may be composed of people from your Recovery Group, family, close friends, or a combination thereof.It’s important to know that while you can and should do a great deal on your own, a support system can make early recovery much easier.People who spend time living with other sober people after treatment are more likely to maintain their sobriety and build a strong program of recovery.
                    </p>
                    <h4>ACTION</h4>
                    <p>
                        Active participation is mandatory in our program.We know everybody’s journey to recovery is different.The is no one size fits all approach to recovery.What works for one member may not work for another.Therefore, we take an ‘all methods’ approach to sobriety, allowing our members to find what works best for their recovery.We have found that this methodology is best suited for increasing the likelihood of success.

                    <h4>Letter from Bryce Givens <br /> CEO of Elevate Recovery Homes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dear Future Elevate Recovery Member, <br />
                    I want to personally convey that I completely understand where you’re at because I’ve been there myself. I’ve suffered plenty due to chronic relapses, both from substances and deplorable behaviors that led me to dark and miserable places. Whether you are currently in primary treatment, intensive outpatient, not in treatment or just wanting to regain control of your life, I’ve been there. I know all the feelings that are associated with jumping into a program: fear, anxiety, excitement, frustration, etc. Even though this feels unique to you, the fact is you are right where you are supposed to be. I took the same challenge and luckily, I have long-term recovery today with an incredibly full life. After several years of half-assing my recovery and toeing the line with my life, at the age of 28, I was done. Done with suffering, done with self-hatred. I was ready to experience all the things people and professionals told me I’d achieve once I went down the path of recovery that I resisted for so long. It takes time, trust, perseverance, and an unwavering commitment. All we are asking for at Elevate is a willingness to take action. None of this work happens overnight. Give yourself the time and just know that it gets easier and easier the longer you utilize what we practice and teach. Recovery is not always easy and there will likely be bumps in the road. Our motivation is to significantly help increase your chances of long-term recovery through Structure, Accountability, Support, and Action.
                    <br />
                    ​Over the years I have witnessed many miracles of recovery including my own. I have seen how my actions, the community of my fellowship, and the Elevate philosophy can help recreate a happy, joyous, and free life. Our program strives to provide an environment for success. We only admit members that are dedicated to our philosophy and the goal of long-lasting sobriety. In order to fully understand, you will have to jump in with both feet and trust the process. I know it’s easier said than done, but trust that this program will elevate your life. You get out what you put in.  “Recovery is not for people who need it, it’s for people who want it!”
                    <br />
                    Best, Bryce Givens
