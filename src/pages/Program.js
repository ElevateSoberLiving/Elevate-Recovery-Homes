                    Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD) is a crisis in America today. More than 21 million Americans are suffering from substance abuse disorder. We lose a loved one every 4 minutes to addiction-related deaths. To combat this, we have developed a program to help our members create a life blueprint. We call it an Elevation Plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elevate Recovery Homes provides a safe, supportive, and progressive approach to recovery. We believe there are many paths to the ultimate goal of lasting sobriety. Built around the four pillars: Structure, Accountability, Support, and Action, your Elevation Plan will lay the blueprint to help guide you in finding the perfect mix of intention and fulfillment for your life in recovery. Your Elevation Plan will be individualized, created alongside experts, to map out your personal journey.

                <h4>STRUCTURE</h4>
                <p>
                    We provide the daily Structure, personal Accountability, community Support, and a plan of Action needed to lead a healthy recovery program. If you are looking for a structured sober living environment and comprehensive after-treatment solutions, Elevate Recovery Homes is the answer
                </p>
                <h4>ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>
                <p>
                    Having people in our lives who hold us accountable for our behavior proves to be extremely helpful. This can help us to stay on track and keep our focus on the things that matter. Honesty and accountability play a vital role in recovery.
                </p>
                <h4>SUPPORT</h4>
                <p>
                    Elevate provides a support system that you can rely on to stay clean and sober. People who spend time living with other sober people after treatment are more likely to maintain their sobriety and build a strong program of recovery.
                </p>
                <h4>ACTION</h4>
                <p>
                    Structure, Accountability, and Support all culminate through consistent Action. The most imperative vehicle in recovery is participating in it. We know from experience that a mind, body, and spirit aligned with intent and perseverance, gives us the best chance for lifelong success.

                <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
                <p>Like life, everything at Elevate Recovery is progressive, with challenges, expectations, and responsibilities increasing as members make healthy choices for themselves. You can expect to immediately feel the love and support as soon as you enter into one of our homes. Someone who has been in the same shoes as you will be there to help guide you through. You can expect us to help with the same passion and purpose that has gotten us to where we are in our recovery. A safe environment will be provided for you to heal, grow, and develop the practices for living a healthy and full life. Every resource we have available will be at your disposal. At Elevate we don’t have clients, we have members because everyone is treated like family.</p>
                <p>Elevate is an achievement-based program with three levels that all members progress through. Each level has specific tasks and goals that allow members to increase their level of responsibility while earning additional privileges. Goals are designed to move members toward increasing independence, personal responsibility, financial freedom, and self-discovery. Each challenge allows members to experience and integrate into their decision-making the daily living skills necessary for independence. Staff guide and challenge members to predict and consider consequences (positive and negative), identify resources, ask for help, improve interpersonal skills, practice problem solving, effectively communicate, demonstrate time management and engage in healthy decision making.</p>
                <p>Our program staff has expertise in physical, emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual development and coaching. We have an in-house nutritionist, personal trainer, weightlifting coach, certified addiction counselor (CACIII), meditation coach, and spiritual development coaches. We also have a vast network of resources to support your progression with employment, life skills development, abuse counseling, and alternative sober advocates.</p>

                <h2>CAREER AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING</h2>
                <p>
                    At Elevate, our mission is to support members in creating a life of purpose and value. As our members work toward attaining autonomy, independence, and personal fulfillment, we encourage them to find meaningful work and career goals that support this endeavor. Knowing who you are, what you’re good at, what excites you, and “how you do you” is vital to that process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We utilize a Career Explorer Aptitude and Assessment test to help individuals identify career paths based on interests, abilities, and personality. Throughout the process, our staff provides members with one-on-one mentoring, attention to detail, and a layer of accountability that helps build momentum and keep goals in focus.
                </p>
                <h4>Online Testing and Analysis Provides Information Members Need to:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify Personal Abilities, Interests, Values, Motivators & Exceptionalities</li>

                <h2>Employment</h2>
                <p>
                    While at Elevate Recovery, all members are required to secure employment. Significant time and resources are devoted to this pursuit. It is our philosophy that work is one of the most therapeutic tools for adult men. Oftentimes our members lack self-confidence in their abilities, have little to no work experience, and are naïve about the value of money and what the cost of living really entails. Most of our members have been supported and even enabled throughout their life by well-meaning family members and haven’t learned how to set up a bank account, pay bills, create a budget, or save for a future goal. We believe that a healthy understanding and appreciation for money is an important demonstration of maturity, gratitude, and responsibility. Throughout their stay at Elevate, financial literacy lessons and challenges are presented to members to instill a healthy relationship with money. At times, we will ask families to refrain from making purchases on behalf of their members to allow for this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our members take advantage of the job opportunities and variety of jobs available to them. Some examples of jobs our members have secured: telemarketing, auto shop mechanic, arborist, bike shop mechanic, barista, grocery store, animal kennel/daycare, construction, and many more. We encourage members to find the job that’s right for them even if that means they need to take a less than desirable position to start. For most of our members, the freedom and decreased supervision that comes when they secure employment is motivation enough to establish a full-time job.
