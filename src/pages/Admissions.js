                <h2>Our Facilities</h2>
                <p>
                    Elevate Recovery provides a location to maximize our member’s ability to engage in a future-focused lifestyle while providing them with the comfort and safety necessary to treat the disease of addiction. In most intensive outpatient drug and alcohol rehab programs, clients visit a facility, receive treatment, and then leave. At Elevate Recovery, our members will have the option to stay at a carefully designed recovery residence and be guided through a process that keeps them engaged and immersed in a lifestyle of recovery, growth, and success throughout each stage of their program.
                </p>
                <h3>HOW WE CAN HELP</h3>
                <h4>STRUCTURE</h4>
                <p>
                    We provide the daily Structure, personal Accountability, community Support, and a plan of Action needed to lead a healthy recovery program. If you are looking for a structured sober living environment and comprehensive after-treatment solutions, Elevate Recovery is the answer
                </p>
                <h4>ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>
                <p>
                    Having people in our lives who hold us accountable for our behavior proves to be extremely helpful. This can help us to stay on track and keep our focus on the things that matter. Honesty and accountability play a vital role in recovery.
                </p>
                <h4>SUPPORT</h4>
                <p>
                    Elevate provides a support system that you can rely on to stay clean and sober. People who spend time living with other sober people after treatment are more likely to maintain their sobriety and build a strong program of recovery.
                </p>
                <h4>ACTION</h4>
                <p>
                    The three other pillars just discussed culminate through consistent action. The most essential instrument in recovery is participating in it. We know from experience that a mind, body, and spirit aligned with intent and perseverance, gives us the best chance for lifelong success.

                <h2>ADMISSION INFORMATION TO HELP YOU GET STARTED</h2>
                <p>
                    The ideal Elevate Recovery member is a man who is currently substance-free and ready to take charge of his life! We look for members who still need some structure and accountability but can also handle the freedoms and temptations of semi-independent living in a large and complex city. We are not in a remote location and everything the world has to offer is practically in our backyard or within a few hours. Combined with our intentional program design, our environment provides the right combination of challenge, support, independence, privacy, responsibility, and accountability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All incoming members must have some sobriety under their belt either from primary treatment, detox, or other intervention. We understand if you’ve had one relapse or many, we understand if you are still contemplating how to live abstinent, and we understand if you aren’t familiar or yet comfortable with the early stages of sobriety.  While you are with us, we can work through all of those pieces together and help you elevate through the necessary steps toward absitance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do, however, require that you be substance-free upon arrival at Elevate. We also ask that you arrive open to trying new things (even if it’s a little uncomfortable) and be open to challenging yourself and your current beliefs and thinking.
                </p>
